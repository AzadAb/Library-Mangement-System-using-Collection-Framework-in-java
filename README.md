📚 Library Management System Using Collection Framework in Java
🚀 About the Project
This is a Library Management System built using Java Collection Framework. It allows users to manage books, issue and return books, and track users efficiently. The project does not use a database but relies on Java's built-in ArrayList and HashMap to store book and user details dynamically.

✨ Features
📖 Add & Remove Books from the library
👥 Register Users to the library system
📚 Issue & Return Books with proper tracking
📂 List Available Books in the library
🔍 Display All Users with their issued books

🛠️ Technologies Used
Java (Core Java & Collection Framework)
OOP Concepts (Encapsulation, Abstraction, etc.)
Data Structures (ArrayList, HashMap)
